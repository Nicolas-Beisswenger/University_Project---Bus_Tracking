# University_Project---Bus_Tracking

This project, developed during university studies, simulates 10 buses operating on a circular route using threads. Each bus operates within a specific time range and is prone to delays at stops (randomly generated), so it integrates a section for delay and event management.

This university project represents an initial effort in simulating operations through a multi-threaded approach.
While functional, it is acknowledged that there are areas where system performance can be improved and optimized.
As part of its academic nature, this project provides a solid foundation upon which future enhancements and technical refinements can be implemented.
